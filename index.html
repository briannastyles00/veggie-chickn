                <p>For the month of August, I decided to challenge myself and temporarily eliminate meat from my diet. However on my second day, I was already withdrawling. In attempts to satisfy my fixations on fried chicken specifically, I decided to do a little research and create my very own faux chick'n pattie.</p>
                <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1596948580209eb71.jpg" alt="Veggie Chick'n Sandwich"> 
                <p></p>
                <p>This recipe is what I was able to come up with after a week of trials and tribulations perfecting the art that is apparently, making things that aren't meaty, meaty. And honestly I'm proud to say, it's delicious! The only thing missing from this recipe is the waffle fries.</p>

                <p>To prepare the seitan, the first thing we need to do is combine our flour and chicken broth mixture. Mix this together until a stiff, but unified dough is made. You can use a stand mixer, but honestly, hands work just as great and really let you marinate that chicken broth thoroughly. 
                </p>
                <center><img class="d-block img-fluid" width="60%" height="auto" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/15969997452b2e4f2.jpg"></center>
                <p></p>
                <p>Form it into a ball and place it into a bowl. Cover the ball with ½ cup of pickle juice and fill with chicken broth until the dough is completely submerged. Let it stand for 4-8 hours, but the longer the better. This will allow us to marinate the chick’n and give it that delicious signature Chick-Fil-A flavor. </p>
                <p></p>
                <center><img class="d-block img-fluid" width="60%" height="auto" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1596999964d123d7c.jpg"></center>
                <p></p>
                <p>After it has been standing for quite some time, the dough will begin to look stringy. Go ahead and rinse the dough in water until the water becomes clear. Make sure to squeeze the dough and press out as much liquid and air as you can. What we are doing right here is rinsing out the starches from the flour and leaving the pure wheat gluten as our patty! Don’t be afraid to spend some time stretching it out and kneading it extensively. This will allow the texture to have air pockets much like actual chicken does. </p>
                <center><img class="d-block img-fluid" width="60%" height="auto" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1597000131e5942e8.jpg"></center>
                <p></p>
                <p>Next, knead in your nutritional yeast, onion powder, poultry seasoning, sea salt and tahini into your dough. Now, roll the dough into smaller patties a little smaller than palm size since they expand during cooking.</p>
                <p></p>
                <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1597088589ce3b76e.png">
                <p>Grab a pot and fill this up halfway with chicken broth so that the patties can be evenly submerged when cooking. Place garlic, onion and tomato into the pot over medium high heat and cook until your onions become translucent. Then place seitan into boiling broth and reduce the heat to low. Let it cook for 20-25 minutes. </p>

                <p></p>
                <p>Remove seitan patties from the pot and place on a towel to allow it to dry. You can press down on each piece to release excess water and allow them to become more firm. </p>
                <p></p>
        
                <center><img class="d-block img-fluid" width="60%" height="auto" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1597000459644b893.jpg"></center>

                <p>Now, we will be preparing our dredging mixtures! In a large bowl, mix all dry dredge ingredients. In a separate bowl, mix those wet dredge ingredients.</p>
                <center><img class="d-block img-fluid" width="60%" height="auto" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1597000596159330d.jpg"></center>

                <p></p>
                <p>In order to really get that crispy, crunchy chicken texture, I will be double-dipping my chick’n patties. Take one seitan piece, dip into dry mixture, then wet and then dry again.
                <p></p>
                <p>Get a large pot or deep fryer and prepare your frying station. You can use any high temperature oil at your disposal. Once your oil is at 260-275 degrees, it’s ready for frying. </p>
                <center><img class="d-block img-fluid" width="60%" height="auto" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/15970008812f521be.jpg"></center>

                <p>Place your pieces into the pot and cook for 3 minutes on each side, or until you are satisfied with the crispness. Make sure not to overcrowd your pot as pieces can stick together if too close.</p>

                <p></p>
                <p>Place on a paper towel to allow excess oil to drain. Prepare your buns with our homemade Chick-Fil-A sauce and toast in a toaster oven for 3 mins on high. Top with pickles and there you have it, a homemade veggie chicken sandwich!</p>

                <p> I could proudly say that this recipe is the gretest hybrid version of the best bits and pieces of the many great chick'n recipies that exist out there. Yes, it's time consuming. Yes, it's a little messy. But it's SO worth it. </p>
                <p> I usually make a good batch of this and just freeze them. These patties are good for six months and are super easy to reheat in the microwave/oven/toaster oven. It's great for salads, snacking, and any other recipe that calls for breaded chicken. </p>

                <p>Andrea Chavez, 21, has been a meat-eater for her entire life. Growing up in a hispanic household, meat functions as the beating heart of her favorite dishes. 
                <P></P>
                A Central Valley native, she's tried the best Mexican food California has to offer, and she can't imagine the cusine as great without meat as its staple. I got to chat over the phone with her this past weekend on her food habits and what she thought about going vegetarian. 
                <p></p>

                <p></p>
                <h5>What has you relationship been to meat? Is it your favorite part of your diet, or do you find it to be less essential than, say, vegetables and dairy? </h5>
                <p>Chavez: Well, I definitely think sometimes I do have cravings for things that aren’t super meaty, like mac and cheese or just a plain quesadilla. But I think in general, it’s something that I like to include in my diet for the protein and sense of feeling full. I feel like because of my upbringing it’s been hard to conceptualize a meal that doesn’t have meat in it.</p>
                <h5>Can you tell us a little bit more about your diet and growing up, and how your hispanic upbringing has shaped your diet today? </h5>
                <p>Chavez: Yea, so growing up, I didn’t set the menu, my mom did. It was very traditional, you know. I would wake up, and my Mama would already be in the kitchen making tortillas de mano. My dad would leave early for work, so in the mornings she would usually just stay up after he left and prepared me and my siblings breakfast. It was never anything super fancy, it stayed somewhere along the lines of beans, eggs, chorizo, caldo de pollo. Her menu would fluctuate depending on if we had dinner leftovers from the night before because those were always a priority. Menudo was never my favorite, haha. There was always some sort of meat in there, even if it wasn’t super necessary, like in beans. She would always add bits of sausage or bacon if she could. </p>
                <p>I think it just grew on me that I enjoyed some sort of protein in the morning to start my days. I grew up with huevos and chorizo for breakfast. How could I ever say no to that? I mean, have you had it? It’s mind blowing. And so affordable too.</p>
                <center><img class="d-block img-fluid" width=50% src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1597125263845bad0.png"></center>
                <p></p>
                <p>I think that’s another point that‘s worth bringing up. It’s so much more affordable to remain eating meat since meat alternatives these days are still so expensive. It’s so much easier to just buy a pack of frozen chicken patties then to go through all this trouble with a faux pattie. I mean props, but wow. I just don’t know how practical this is for a busy student like me. I would love to one day, but it doesn’t fit with my lifestyle right now as a broke college student. </p>
                <h5>You mentioned loving to be less reliant on meat--can you expand on why you believe so?</h5>
                <p>Chavez: I mean, I do think there is a lot of truth to what animal activists talk about. Animal cruelty is definitely playing a part in the meat industry, and questions about whether it’s ethical or not still run through my head. I think that we humans really weren’t meant to eat meat. Sometimes I do feel a little disgusting after I eat something. It’s just the knowledge of knowing too much about the food industry. But I think it is definitely an inner battle to stop eating in completely and if it’s an accessible option for me. </p>
                <p>Also, I think it’s just clean eating. I know I’ve heard of meat possibly being linked to cancer and other diseases, so yea. I would love it. I just don’t know how realistic it is for me at this point in my life. </p>
                <h5>If not now, when? Do you think this will ever be possible in your life to become vegetarian?</h5>
                <p>Chavez: Good question. I think right now since I’m still living at home and my mom still does most of the cooking for me, I don’t think she would be so accommodating to a diet like that. And I also think I don’t have the correct mindset towards it to really take initiative and discipline myself in that way. </p>
                <p>Once I move out though, I think it will be easier to control what I eat because of course, I’ll be doing the grocery shopping. So yea, maybe at that point I would consider it. But honestly, I think everything in moderation can be healthy. I think when I’m older, I’ll try to limit how many times I eat meat to be only on special occasions or when it’s really the center to the dish.</p>

                <p></p>
                <p>Like, maybe I’ll pass up McDonald’s, but if my parents are having a carne asada, then I’m having tacos. It’s just so ingrained in me and I enjoy it. My parents stayed alive because they ate the animals they had on their ranch. I think if you have a wholesome relationship with something, it’s difficult to let go of something so positively associated with your identity. </p>
                <h5>Ending Notes from the Author</h5>
                <p> I hope this recipe gave folks a bright side to going vegetarian. Whether you are vegetarian or not, I strongly encourage you to try new foods because maybe, you'll like something you didn't necessarily expect!</p>
